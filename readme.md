# Office Licensing Fixer
Easy and simple GUI to clear Office 365 accounts from Office to enable a new account to be entered. This script uses the Office Software Protection Platform script found in Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office16 folder. 

This program is designed to be used when Office is un-licensed with someone else's account and will not allow you to enter in another account. It will find all the keys/accounts and remove them from Office allowing you to re-enter your office 365 details to license the program.
